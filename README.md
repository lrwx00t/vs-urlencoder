# url-encoder README

The URL Encoding/Decoding extension for Visual Studio Code (VSCode) allows encoding or decoding selected text using percent encoding. Percent/URL encoding is a process of converting special characters to their equivalent representation in the ASCII character set, which is used in URLs.

After installing the extension, select the desired text and open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+p`) and select encode/decode actions.
